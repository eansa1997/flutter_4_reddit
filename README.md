# flutter4reddit

A new Flutter application for reddit.   
Reddit API package: [draw](https://pub.dev/packages/draw)  
Reddit API package only supports user login mode for installed applications.      
State management done with a hybrid provider/stream approach.

Misc:
- Only clicking on an image thumbnail is supported, video thumbnails are out of scope of this project due to complexity.
- Features may be added randomly but feel free to fork this if you want to make it your own.
- Post selftext is sometimes weird, like tables generated by r/nba boxscores. If you find a better way to handle the data, please do a pull request.
